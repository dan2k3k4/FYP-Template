\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:introduction}
\textit{Think about trying to set the scene for your report by giving an overview of your topic area and show how this fits into the broader area of Information Systems/Computer Science/Applied Computing/Network Computing. Give a brief overview of existing research and industry work in your topic (the full description will come in your literature review). Try to demonstrate that there is a gap in current knowledge or practice and use this to show why your own work is valuable. This should lead into a statement of the problem or research question that your report addresses.}


\section{Aims and Objectives}
\textit{State your intended aim and present your measurable objectives. The aim and objectives may be the original or a revised version of those found in your research proposal. Make sure that you have discussed and agreed any major changes in the aims and objectives with your supervisor.}

\section{Research Approach}
\textit{Give a brief overview of methods you used to achieve your intended aim and meet your individual measurable objectives.}

\textit{Note that if you are involving human participants within your research, when reporting your research approach in more detail later in the report, you should include a brief summary of the measures taken to prevent contraventions of ethical guidelines.}
 

\section{Dissertation Outline}

% Lit Review

\chapter{Literature Review}\label{chap:literature}
\section{Introduction}
You'll need to complete a Literature Review, which should detail the background about why you are planning to do your project, comparison of other solutions that exist and definition of new concepts that may not be known to the reader. Ideally you should pretend the reader is a CS or IS student who has completed Level 2, so any concepts you plan to use should be highlighted and outlined in some detail.

\section{Example Table}
Here I'll just import a table by using the input command. It's better to use other .tex files to write your tables as they can become quite messy. I used an Excel2LaTeX (or Excel2Tex) script to make tables easily, though it does still require some tweaking for the size.

\input{table_example.tex}

\autoref{tab:example_1} shows a bunch of example rows and columns, note I used autoref because it is more readable when it shows Table rather than just the number.

\section{Example Referencing}
Here is how you can easily reference someone \citep{Smith2011}. \Citet{Goodmans2010} reported that everything worked really well and \citet{Johnson992} also agreed. Sometimes you might want to reference multiple things in the same quote as they all say the same thing \citep{LavinMera2008,Martin2007,RoyalSociety2010}.

\section{Summary}
The last section of each chapter (first and last chapters excluded) should be a brief summary of the chapter (1 paragraph) and a brief description of how it moves on to the next chapter (1 paragraph).


Note I've not included all the various chapters that you might want to use. This is because you may have a very different outline/structure for your report and you should be more creative to write something that will interest the reader.


\clearpage
% Implementation

\chapter{Implementation}\label{chap:implementation}
\section{Introduction}
This chapter details the development process...

\section{How I did it all}
Add sections and subsections to detail how you implemented your "program"

\subsection{In detail}
...and try to do it in as much detail as possible, answering all the possible "why did you do it this way" type of questions that you can think of.

\section{Summary}
\textit{The last section of each chapter (first and last chapters excluded) should be a brief summary of the chapter (1 paragraph) and a brief description of how it moves on to the next chapter (1 paragraph).}

\clearpage
% Testing

\chapter{Testing and Evaluation}\label{chap:testing}
\section{Introduction}
Maybe you want to do some testing and evaluation, or you might want to include this chapter within the implementation chapter. If you're doing IC, you might not have much testing to do, where-as CS students may require a lot more testing.

\section{Summary}
This chapter has presented...

\autoref{chap:conclusion} documents the conclusion of this project along with a personal reflection.

\clearpage % I like to do /clearpage between chapters to ensure all images and floated stuff is put on the correct chapter
%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Concluding Discussion

\chapter{Concluding Discussion}\label{chap:conclusion}
\textit{This chapter gives a summary of the main points of the report, presents the contributions made and discusses possible future activity that evolves from the project.}

\section{Summary of the dissertation}
\textit{A chapter by chapter summary of main points of the report.}

\section{Achievements}
\textit{Presentation of the projects achievements. You should discuss their value and how they can be applied both academically and practically?}

\section{Future research or development}
\textit{How can your achievements be exploited further? By you or by a student next year or by the beneficiaries? What further research could be pursued from your dissertation and how? Note that no research or development is perfect and there will be limitations to your work. Discuss them here, but use them in a positive way by describing how future work could overcome these limitations.}

\section{Personal Reflection}
\textit{This is a requirement for BCS accreditation. Comment on your personal strengths and weakness' that you are aware of as a result of completing the Final Year Project module. Where weaknesses are identified, comment on what steps you might take in the future to overcome them.}

\subsection{Knowledge Gained}
I lost braincells drinking and haven't really gained any knowledge, I'm just writing a long sentence to ensure it takes up some room on this example report. I would highly recommend taking a long nap right about now.
